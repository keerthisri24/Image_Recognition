# Image_Recognition

After preprocessing the image dataset to delete corrupted images, we created a Tensorflow MobileNetV2 Model to detect images of cats and dogs. We tested 15 different models and 
completed parameter tuning to discover which model produced the best results in terms of accuracy. We found that the model with 8 layers, sigmoid activation function, 0.0001 learning
rate, and 1 Alpha gave us the highest test accuracy of 0.9824 and a test loss of 0.0502.

Please look at the .ipynb file for our code and the Report pdf to gain more understanding of our anlaysis with visualizations.
